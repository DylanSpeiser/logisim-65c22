# logisim-65c22
An implementation of the 65c22 VIA chip in Logisim-evolution.

As of 10/5/22, the only implemented features are the data input and output capabilities. I am working on implementing the other features.
(Ignore the Port_Buffer and Transistor_Test modules, they are internal to the chip.)

My resource for implementation is the official datasheet, found here: http://archive.6502.org/datasheets/wdc_w65c22s_mar_2004.pdf

Enjoy!
